# FLEK :crab: :ribbon:

***A Rustacean implementation of my own algorithms to check for password security.:crab: :ribbon:***

## ABOUT :books:

This is my Rust implementation of a package I wrote in [Dart](https://github.com/angeldollface/securitycheck) roughly a year ago and implemented also in [ECMA Script](https://github.com/angeldollface/vulcheck) only a couple of days ago. These packages all do one thing: They provide functions for you to check whether your passwords are secure or not. My algorithm gives your password a score and if the score is higher than eight, then the password is deemed to be secure. Why ***Flek***? The name is a combination of the words ***Fl***aw and Ch***e(c)k***. All of these packages implement an algorithm of my own design and have all been optimized to be as fast as possible. Enjoy. :heart:

## INSTALLATION :inbox_tray:

To use ***Flek*** in your Rust project, add this line to your project's `Cargo.toml`:

```TOML
flek = { git = "https://github.com/angeldollface/flek", version = "1.1.0" }
```

## USAGE :hammer:

For usage instuctions on ***Flek***'s functions, please check out `lib.rs`.
